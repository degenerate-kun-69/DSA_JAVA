bit manipulation is basically doing bitwise operations on a number
for example

get bit
for getting the ith bit of a number n
create a bit mask : 1<<i where << is left shift operator
then perform AND operation on them
for eg, getting the 3rd bit (pos 2) of a number n (n=0101)
create a bit mask 1<<2
0001<<2
0100
0100 AND 0101
0100

Set bit
Bit mask 1<<i
operation OR

clear bit
bit mask 1<<i
operation : AND with not
n&(~bitMask)

update bit
operation=what bit to change it to
if want to update it to zero,
use clear bit
if want to update it to 1,
use set bit
